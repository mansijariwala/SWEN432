Part 1: This kind of targeted killing is rooted in the British colonial practice of air policing from the 1920s. Decades later, as the CIA’s Predators struck al- Qaeda militants in the same region, the U.S. military’s focus subsequently shifted to al-Qaeda  offshoots, including the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, al- Shabab in Somalia, al-Qaeda  in the Arabian Peninsula, and more dispersed threats across the Maghreb and Sahara regions. Indeed, an increased— although uneven— militarization of Africa is apparent, with a variety of U.S. surveillance operations expanding across the continent.
Part2: Shaw (2016), the history and progress of US drone warfare, with a particular concentrate on "deterrritorialisation" and "enclosure" as core approach in the rise of what he names the ‘Predator Empire’. This new ‘Empire’ is founded on the existential force of technology in modern life: technology, such as drones, is changing how human beings interact and relate not only with each other, but also with the world at large. Per Shaw, both a driving force and a result of the Predator Empire is the deterritorialisation of conflict.  Relating to the concept of enclosure, Shaw (2016) further examines the development of enclosure and concludes it is inextricably connected with the evolution of, and increased dependence on, technology.
The U.S. military has been, and remains, a world leader in remote targeted killings. The drone has become central to U.S. national security strategy, which has switched from counterinsurgency in the city to counterterrorism from the skies. Whatever the size of the drone, they all essentially perform the same functions: intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). From monitoring North Vietnamese troops in the 1960s to stalking al-Qaeda targets in Pakistan, the military has long desired eyes in the sky. Today, these eyes are becoming increasingly robotic and are part of a radical realignment of military power in the twenty- first century: the “dronification of state violence.” (Shaw & Akhter, 2014)Thus, “the electronic atmosphere” has initiated an important spatial revolution that geography is no longer as important as it once was to either communications or security. 
 
Part3: Shaw (2016) points out the connection between the digital enclosures of the earth helping globalized warfare in pursuit of security. Drones are now being used in national policing efforts in the United States, bringing weapons of war home in a quite literal sense: the Department of Defense 1033 Program allows for surplus weapons and systems to be transferred to national police forces in the United States for deployment in policing (214-35). Military grade armored vehicles and lethal weapons, including grenade launchers and M-16 rifles, count among the various types of equipment so far transferred. 
 
Part4: With recent U.S. air strikes across Iraq and Syria, together with a global ISR infrastructure, there is a sense in which battlefield is an archaic geographical term. The U.S. national security state is increasingly based on this borderless form of sovereignty, one that resonates with a range of extrajudicial spaces of control: from shadowy cyberwars against Iran to mass domestic surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA) to expanding drone surveillance across Africa.
Take Camp Lemonnier as an example. This is the U.S. military’s only permanent base in Africa, located in Djibouti’s main airport, and has served as a drone base for years (although nearby Chabelley Airfield now houses most drones). Thousands of U.S. special forces, civilians, and contractors have passed through this base as part of a strategy to target and eliminate Islamic militants in Yemen and Somalia and across the Sahel and Sahara. The twenty- first- century militarization of Africa is the latest phase in a globalizing U.S. security infrastructure that is converting the planet into a single battlespace and changing the geographies of state violence.
Part 5: The Djibouti base is part of a growing network of military bases that house drones across the planet. While many of the gargantuan U.S. bases in Iraq and Afghanistan are now relics of the occupation, the U.S. military has been busy constructing smaller, more remote outposts across the world. These so- called lily pads aim to cover more of the planet with less of a footprint. The territorial extent of U.S. sovereignty has been significantly expanded by this strategy. The list of countries that have been surveilled by U.S. drones, or have housed U.S. drones, is long and includes Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Seychelles, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. The drone atlas is constantly shifting. And back in the U.S homeland, the everyday spaces of human coexistence are being increasingly targeted by a dronified form of policing preoccupied with surveilling every facet of life.
 
Part 6: Furthermore, Shaw emphasizes on the study and advancements of Nano-drones and swarming technology, which will further diminish the national sovereignty with more permeable boundaries and the secrecy of the United States civilians as these technologies are accommodated into the current surveillance architecture. Operators on the opposite side of the planet to the drone they are controlling are capable of killing with an ease never before seen in human history. Drone technology, both current and future, is being introduced into national politicking as well as being deployed in international conflict. 
Part 7: Many scholars writing about drones mobilize their critiques around international law or ethics. The growing use of drones, warns Peter Singer, could transform the “public into the equivalent of sports fans watching war, rather than citizens sharing in its importance. But such concerns about the aesthetics of killing leave untouched the dominion of humans over their technological creations. Drones are viewed as tools of state power, used by rational actors for rational ends. Rather than being understood as instruments, drones are seen as geopolitical agents creating new modes of state power. The materiality matters. But there are “unknown unknowns” set in motion with the birth of every machine. Technologies can rebel and transform their surrounding world, like a virus that reprograms the cells of its unwitting host. A sprawling set of surveillance apparatuses— roaming across land, sea, and outer space—now leave few places left on earth to hide. Drone warfare, in short, requires us to seek new ways to understand empire.
 
Part 8: After the brutal counterinsurgencies of Iraq and Afghanistan, Washington’s war managers scrambled to find a new strategy. Their response was to do more with less as robots, drones, and satellites began to redistribute and replace human bodies (and therefore vulnerabilities): shifting personnel from the frontline and putting them in service of their robotic proxies. A vast policing infrastructure of machines, special forces, drones, and software algorithms hunt for threats across a totalizing battle space that connects the homeland with the battlefield. With news that one hundred thousand troops were being cut from the U.S. military in 2012, it became clear the drone wars were here to stay (BBCNews, 2012).
Telegraphs, railways, tanks, aircraft, nuclear weapons, drones, and the Internet have all brought with them distinct geographies of violence and control. In this sense, geopolitics is overrun by technological forces: electronic infra structures rewire international relations in profound ways. Indeed, in less than a decade targeted killings delivered by Predator drones have become so normalized that the Obama administration has constructed a streamlined bureaucratic database for administering death. The disposition matrix contains an electronic list of suspects targeted for elimination across the planet.
